## Description

### Project Background
I started karting in summer 2022 and I enjoy this sport with every inner piece of mine. 
But as time went buy, one of my bookshelves became an archive for result papers.
At the same time I was looking for a project idea to explore backend development with NodeJS and deployment with AWS or Azure.
As a result, an idea of Squacker - web application to keep lap times in a convenient way - came up.

### Tech
- NodeJS v16
- Mongo DB
- Mongoose
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- AWS Route 53
- AWS Certificate Manager
